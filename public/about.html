<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Siddhant Baiswar from Nagpur, Maharashtra and I am a student of IIITM Gwalior. I am interested in lots of diverse
  fields that include (but are not limited to) science, mathematics, literature, philosophy, music, psychology and the human biology. I love stories so I read a lot of novels and books. I like to play badminton and table tennis and am also an 
  athlete.</p>

<p>I am a web developer, an ML and AI enthusiast and curious to learn any technology that exists in the digital and virtual world.
  I think computer technology is my calling because I feel I can never get enough of it.
